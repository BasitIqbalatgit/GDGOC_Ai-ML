    "# Introduction to OOP in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses **objects** to model real-world entities by bundling data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together. In Python, OOP helps in organizing code, making it modular, reusable, and easier to map real-world problems into software solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "OOP is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Each object represents an instance of a class that encapsulates attributes (data) and methods (behaviors).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (object).\n",
    "- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details behind a simple interface.\n",
    "- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** Allowing different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP brings several benefits that are especially valuable when building and maintaining complex systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity:** Code is organized into self-contained objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Once a class is written, it can be reused across different parts of an application.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** OOP designs can be extended and modified with minimal impact on existing code.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Logical grouping of code into classes makes debugging and enhancements more straightforward.\n",
    "- **Mapping to Real-World Problems:** OOP helps in modeling real-world scenarios more intuitively, making the code easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "A class in Python serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the created objects will have.\n"
